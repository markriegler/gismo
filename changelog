* API:
  - gsOptProblem::numConstraints() returned the number of lower bounds (which are box constraints). Now it returns the member m_numConstraints which is a user-defined flag. This keeps it functional for non-linear constraints, but the user has to set it explicitly. -- https://github.com/gismo/gismo/pull/721

Only `gsBSplineBasis::evalAllDersSingle_into` overloads, but throws a warning for a bug anyways. -- https://github.com/gismo/gismo/pull/712
